Instruction:
${instruction}

Make all necessary changes to that session, including:
- Updating the session "summary" to reflect any changes to events or NPCs
- Ensuring the session "npcs" list only includes NPCs actively involved in that session's events
- Adjusting any related NPCs if their appearance or role changes
- If the overall campaign summary needs to be revised to reflect major changes, return an updated version

Maintain continuity in the overall story.

- Include:

- a detailed "summary" (3â€“5 sentences minimum)
- a list of key "events"
- an array of involved NPC IDs ("npcs")
- If new NPCs are introduced, define them with:
- "id"
- "name"
- "role"
- "alive"
- "firstAppearsIn": session number
- optional "notes"
- If the story arc significantly changes, return an updated campaign "summary".
