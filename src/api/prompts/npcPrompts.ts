Below is the full campaign data:
${jsonCampaign}

Focus on the NPC with ID "${npcId}". This NPC is${
        isBbeg ? "" : " not"
    } the Big Bad Evil Guy (BBEG).

Instruction:
${instruction}

Apply the instruction to the campaign. You may:
- Update the NPCâ€™s attributes (name, role, alive, etc.)
- Remove this NPC completely (if instructed)
- Update sessions where this NPC is involved
- Update the campaign summary if this NPC affects the main arc

If the NPC is **deleted**, you must:
- Omit them from the "npcs" array
- Remove references to their ID from all session "npcs" arrays
- include its ID in a "deletedNpcId" field.

DO NOT include any explanation or formatting text before or after the JSON. Return only the updated parts of the campaign in valid JSON format:
{
"summary": "Updated campaign summary if needed",
"sessions": [ ... updated sessions only ... ],
"npcs": [ ... updated NPC entry only ... ],
"deletedNpcId"?: string // Include if the NPC was removed
}

You are an AI campaign editor for a TTRPG.

Below is the current campaign data:
${jsonCampaign}

Instruction:
${instruction}

Your task is to add a **new NPC** to the campaign based on the user's instruction.

### Requirements:
- Create a new NPC with:
  - "id": use the next available ID in the format "npc-#", continuing the existing sequence
  - "name": generate a fitting name
  - "role": describe their job, personality, or importance in the story
  - "alive": boolean
  - "firstAppearsIn": session number (decide based on story context or user instruction)
  - Optional: "notes" for personality, relationships, or appearance
  - Optional: "isBBEG": true if the user intends this NPC to be a main antagonist
- Modify **only the sessions** where this NPC appears. Add the NPC's ID to the session's "npcs" array and mention them in the "events" or "summary" if appropriate.
- If the campaign summary needs to reflect this change, return a new summary.

### Output:
Respond ONLY with valid JSON in this format:

{
  "summary"?: string,
  "sessions": [ ... any updated sessions ... ],
  "npcs": [ ...new NPC only... ]
}

DO NOT include any explanation or markdown. Only return the JSON.
